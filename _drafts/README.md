My own github page

You can try it here: [sylhare.github.io](https://sylhare.github.io/index.html)

## Github Information 
### Language on Github

How the language bot recognise what is in your repository (the colored bar on top of it) : [github-linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml)

Here is a cool website with all the languages used on github: [githut](http://githut.info/)

### Github API

Github has an API that can be use to develop scripts  or create application linked on it (the integrations below for example).
Here is the link to the API documentation : [github Developer](https://developer.github.com/v3/)

### Github Badges

A thing, I was looking for are the badges used to customise and give precious information on the `readme.md` file on each repository. Some are generated automatically (like the build badge from travis).

Others are available as `.svg` available here:

- [For the Badge](https://forthebadge.com/)

	[![forthebadge](http://forthebadge.com/images/badges/60-percent-of-the-time-works-every-time.svg)](http://forthebadge.com)

- [shields.io](http://shields.io/)

## Github Integration

### Documentation
#### GitBook
Available to write your own book on github: [https://www.gitbook.com/book/sylhare/manual/details](https://www.gitbook.com/book/sylhare/manual/details)

The view version is linked to my github url: [https://sylhare.gitbooks.io/manual](https://sylhare.gitbooks.io/manual)

### Code Reviews
#### Code Climate
IT will give a rating to you repository (python, javascript, java) based on general code rules (duplication of code, display, ...). A good way to improve your coding style.
Dashboard available here: [https://codeclimate.com/dashboard](https://codeclimate.com/dashboard)

#### QuantifiedCode
Check for python errors and convention mistake on Python. Plus gives some insights on how to correct them. Easy to use. It's based on [pyLint](https://www.pylint.org/) and PEP8 style guide corrections.

Automated code review and repair for Python: [https://github.com/integrations/quantifiedcode](https://github.com/integrations/quantifiedcode)

Access the [Dashboard](https://www.quantifiedcode.com/app/projects).

#### Codacy
Automated code reviews to help developers ship better software, faster: [https://github.com/integrations/codacy](https://github.com/integrations/codacy)

You can try on your repository and a rank (like code climate) is attributed on your [Dashboard](https://www.codacy.com/projects). It recognizes java, python, javascript ...

The errors are categorized depending on the type and there's also some advices on how to correct them.

### Perfomrance
#### Opbeat <a href="https://opbeat.com" title="Opbeat"><img src="http://opbeat-brand-assets.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/svg/logo/logo.svg" align="right" height="25px"></a>
Gives a mark based on code standard for your code, works for Javacript.
JavaScript performance monitoring synch with deployment tool (heroku for example): [https://opbeat.com/](https://opbeat.com/)

There's some extra steps that will be necessary to do when making it available. I don't have active webapp so I can only have a limited use of it.


### Continuous Integration (CI)
#### Travis CI
Have a test configuration file and allow travis to start building the repository to see if the build passes or fails
Automatic test and deploy: [https://travis-ci.org/](https://travis-ci.org/)

#### Solano CI
Work with a `solano.yml` file, similar as travis CI.
Massively Parallel Continuous Integration and Deployment: [https://github.com/integrations/solano-ci](https://github.com/integrations/solano-ci)

The dashboard is avalaible [here](https://ci.solanolabs.com/#) for: *JUnit, Java, Scala, Clojure, Javascript, Go, NodeJS and Io.js, PHP, Python, Ruby, R, Erlang*.

#### Cicle CI
It works with a dashboard in which you can see all targeted repository. Works the same as the other two with a `circle.yml` for configuration.
Automatically build, test, and deploy your project in minutes: [https://github.com/integrations/circle-ci](https://github.com/integrations/circle-ci)

The Circle CI dashboard is available [here](https://circleci.com/dashboard) for this supported languages: *Clojure, Elixir, Go, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby*

#### Heroku
Enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud
Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that: https://www.heroku.com/
Getting started: https://devcenter.heroku.com/start 

Langauges: *Java, Ruby, nodeJS, Go, php, python, scala Clojure*

### Code Coverage

#### Codecov
Information on how to set up codecov: [here](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/supported-languages)
Code coverage done right: [integrations codecov](https://github.com/integrations/codecov)

Access to my [dashboard](https://codecov.io/gh/Sylhare)
