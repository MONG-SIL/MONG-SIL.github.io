There are some information, that I feel are pertinent while messing around with a docker.
May it be alone or to be deploy in a cluster. Here is my list of tips.

## Make that Docker run

Let's say you have an image named `image` to ease the annotation. 
And let's assume `mycontainer` is a terrific name for a container.

### Difference between ENTRYPOINT and CMD

Let's say you have you have a dockerfile like that:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:16.04

ENTRYPOINT ["echo", "Hello"]
CMD ["World"]
```

If you run the docker you should get:

```bash
docker --rm run --name mycontainer image
Hello world
docker --rm run github --name mycontainer image 
Hello github
```

Basically, you can use both or just one of them. When you run the docker they will behave like:
  - `ENTRYPOINT` can't be overridden, but can take argument (or not) and will be executed. 
  - `CMD` is a command that will be run by default, that can be overridden with `exec`.


### Some override examples

Here are some tips, I found useful in different occasion to make your docker run.

 - Running detached using `-d`:
```bash 
docker run -d --name mycontainer image
``` 
 - Delete the container after running `--rm` to avoid the `docker rm --force mycontainer`
 ```bash
 docker run --rm --name mycontainer image
 ```
 - Execute yolo within the container using `exec` which run a process in your docker:
 ```bash
 docker run --name mycontainer image
 docker exec -it mycontainer /bin/bash
 docker exec mycontainer /bin/sh -c "echo 'hello';echo 'world';echo '!'"
 ```



## Using variables

### Internal env variables

The basic to have environment variables in your docker would be to use `ENV` like:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:16.04

ENV FIRST=hello
ENV SECOND=world!

CMD ['echo $FIRST $SECOND']
```

But sometime you want those variables to be secret and not saved in your dockerfile.
To do so, you may have multiple options


### External env variables

You can also define environment variables from the command line using `-e` for each variables, 
or use `-env-file` if you have a file with all of your variables.

```bash
docker build -t example .
docker run -e FIRST='hello' -e SECOND='world!' example
docker run --env-file ./env_file.txt example
```

You dockerfile will be like, notice the absence of `ENV`.

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:16.04

CMD ['echo $FIRST $SECOND']
```

### Using arguments

You can use arguments, which are defines already in your dockerfile and can be set to have default 
values. Like all commands above, it can be used both in `docker build` or `docker run`.

```bash
docker build -t example .
docker run --build-arg FIRST='hello' --build-arg SECOND='world!' example
```

You dockerfile will be like, notice the usage of `ARG`.

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:16.04

ARG FIRST
ARG SECOND

CMD ['echo $FIRST $SECOND']
```

## Exchange files and folder with your container
### Directly in your dockerfile

Sometime your docker file is in your project and all the files you need are already there.
So you can just create a work directory with `WORKDIR` so you don't mess your docker internals by placing your stuff directly 
at the root `/`. And then just copy your project in that working directory.

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:16.04

WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app

ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash"]
```

But some other time, you want to add some files while running your docker, 
That's when you need to inject files in your container.

### Mount files in your container

You can directly mount in your docker files using `-v`. 
Note that you need to give the absolute path on the host for it work, you can use `$PWD` which give your current location.

```bash
docker run --net=host -v "$PWD/src":/target --name mycontainer image
```

This way you inject your `/src` directory as `/target` at root level in your docker container. 

### Copy from and to the container
#### Get your container ID

Before copying you need to know which container you want to operate.
Let say you are running a docker, knowing its name, you want to get its id:

```bash
docker run --name mycontainer image 
id=$(docker ps -aqf "name=mycontainer")
echo $id
```

#### Manage files in your container

Then you can use that id to manage files with the container:

```bash
# From your container to the host
docker cp $id:/src/. target
# From the host to your container
docker cp src/. $id:/target
```
