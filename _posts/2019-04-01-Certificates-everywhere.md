Certificates are everywhere ...
Usually you don't see them, everything works fine until it does not. 
The most common place with certificate errors will be on website not using them or with errors.

*Like your connection is not secure, you're going to die and all your data will be hacked*

I might be exaggerating, it's not that complicated and you might not always getting hacked, but you surely gonna die.
Anyway, how does it work?

## Let's get started ðŸ˜Ž

### From a client side

Here would be a lousy explanation of random typical workflow:

Basically, when somebody (let's say _"Carl's app"_) tries to connect to you:
>  - What's up who are you, what do you offer?

You can test it with this command to get the certificate manually:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect host:port
```

Then "Carl's app" answer, _"hey it's me"_ giving you its public certificate (like an id to prove he's legit and all).
But you go:
>  - Don't know you, but it written that Carl's knows you, but who the heck is Carl? Like I don't have all day, already a millisecond!
  
Yeah because Carl created his app public key with his own key private key. That's call signing the public key.
 So here "Carl's app" public key looks like:

```
-----BEGIN-----
Hi,

 Server is legit 
 
Carl
-----END-----
```
 
So then Carl gives is public key, saying I'm cool bro, look even Google say so, he signed my key. 
And then you check and see that his public is checked by Google (which is one of the root certificate provider used to sign other certificates).
Once you get this certification, you know that server is indeed legit and you can start the encrypted and trusted connection.

>  - You are "secured"!

All this is called the PKI (Public key infrastructure).

### From a server side

The server to create his public key signed by another authority uses a [CSR](https://www.sslshopper.com/what-is-a-csr-certificate-signing-request.html) (Certificate Signing Request),
And you can get your csr from the server key using:

```bash
$ openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -out servername.csr -keyout servername.key

-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----

-----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
```

This one is given to another authority to create the signed public key. 
Usually you can use `entrust certificate` which are common on the web, you don't go up to Google or big company own certificate to validate a simple web request.
 
But that `root` certificate at the end of the chain exists and usually it has a public key known by a lot of people, 
and a private key that is kept secret in a vault that is used to create the chain.


### With a truststore

You can in your application add your certificates in a truststore.
Usually truststore are used for SSL handshakes. you can do that with `keytool` using this command:

```bash 
keytool -noprompt -keystore client.truststore.jks -alias my-custom-cert-alias -import -file newcert.crt -storepass "changeit" -keypass "changeit"
```

And to check the certificate in the truststore use:

```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore client.truststore.jks -storepass "changeit"
```

You are now all set to explore the wonders of certificates! Good luck, you will need it because they expire all the times.
