## What is a üê¨ Dolphin attack?

A Dolphin attack is a term that has been given to the method of accessing a smartphone 
without the users‚Äô consent by executing ultrasonic commands.
A [study](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09537) conducted at Zhejiang University in China has shown that such speech recognition systems
 are vulnerable to hidden commands that the researchers are calling ‚ÄúDolphin Attacks‚Äù.
How do you hide a voice command? Make it ultrasonic. Humans hear sounds between 20 Hz and 20kHz. 
If you record a phrase, and shift it above 20 kHz, then play it back, you can‚Äôt hear it, but dogs, bats, dolphins and,
 unfortunately, phone and computer microphones can. [from fraud watch international](https://fraudwatchinternational.com/expert-explanations/what-is-a-dolphin-attack/)

‚ÄúDolphin Attacks‚Äù can be used to [from UW-Madison](https://it.wisc.edu/news/dolphin-attack-hacking-phones-via-ultrasound/):

  - Open malicious websites, which can launch a drive-by-download attack or exploit a device with 0-day vulnerabilities.
  - Spy on users by initiating outgoing video/phone calls, therefore getting access to video or sound of the devices surroundings.
  - Inject fake information by sending fake text messages and emails, online posts, calendar events, etc.
  - Deny service, by turning on airplane mode, disconnecting all wireless communications.
  - Conceal attacks by dimming the targeted device‚Äôs screen and lowering its speaker volume.    

## The challenge

In one of the challenges, you get access to this audio:

<audio controls src="{{"/assets/other/dolphin.wav" | relative_url}}">
<p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 audio. Here is a <a href="{{"/assets/other/dolphin.wav" | relative_url}}">link to the audio</a> instead.</p></audio>

Thankfully we had heard about the `dolphin attack` vector (and the obvious name of the challenge),
 we decided to find out if there was any hidden message in the audio.

The Audio opened in audacity reveals nothing on first hand:

![image]({{"assets/img/dolphin-before.png" | relative_url }})

Unfortunately we did not succeed in attacking ourselves (I guess Apple had patch this flow on their side at the date of the competition).
So after some [looking around](https://forum.audacityteam.org/viewtopic.php?t=95331), we found how to get the message by demodulating the signal 
in amplitude using a nyquist prompt in Audacity:

```bash
;version 4
    (setf cf 37000) ; the carrier frequency
    (let ((demod (mult *track* (hzosc cf))))
      (lowpass8 demod 10000))
```

Basically we filter everything under the high frequency and bring to audible level the hidden attack audio:
 
![image]({{"assets/img/dolphin-after.png" | relative_url }})

<audio controls src="{{"/assets/other/dolphin-after.wav" | relative_url}}">
<p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 audio. Here is a <a href="{{"/assets/other/dolphin.wav" | relative_url}}">link to the audio</a> instead.</p></audio>

If you play the audio you should hear:
