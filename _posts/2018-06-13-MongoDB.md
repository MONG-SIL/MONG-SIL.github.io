MongoDB is a Document Oriented Database, a type of **NoSQL** database. 
It is open source and available at [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com).

### Document Storage

**Document databases** pair each key with a complex data structure known as a document. 
Documents can contain many different key-value pairs, or key-array pairs, or even nested documents.

### Mongo DB example

MongoDB stores data in flexible, **JSON-like documents** called **collection**. 
Each element of the database is stored as a separate JSON. Mongo can generate a database out of this file.

```js
db.inventory.insertMany([
   // MongoDB adds the _id field with an ObjectId if _id is not present
   { item: "journal", qty: 25, status: "A" },
   { item: "notebook", qty: 50, status: "A" },
   { item: "paper", qty: 100, status: "D" },
   { item: "planner", qty: 75, status: "D" },
]);
```

### Actions with Mongo

Mongo provides you with different type of actions to query the database, it follows the CRUD:

- Insert: to add new element in the database

```js
db.collection_name.insert({"fieldname":"value"})
```

- Find: which lets you find and read elements in the database 

```js
db.inventory.find( {} )               // Will return all document in the collection
db.inventory.find( { status: "D" } )  // Searching filtering by a value
```

- Update: to update the elements

```js
db.collection_name.update()
```

- Remove: to delete element of the database

```js
db.collection_name.remove({"fieldname":"value"})
```

### Deployment

The mongoDB can be deployed in different configuration:

- **Stand alone** is a simple instance of the mongo DB, just the database.

- **Replica Set** is a set of three database with one primary and two secondary. 
    - If one is down then one of the two secondary gets elected to primary automatically. 
    - All db have the same data in it.

- **Shard Cluster** is composed of multiple replica set that shares the data of a collection (according to set rules).
    - The applications connect to the Database through a `Mongo S` application
    - The `Mongo S` will direct the request to the right replica set using a config replica set that knows where the information is stored.
