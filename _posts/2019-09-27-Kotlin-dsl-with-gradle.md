## Introduction

So here a bit of details:

- Gradle is an open source build automation system.
- Kotlin is a general purpose, open source, statically typed programming language for both functional and object oriented programming.
- A DSL (domain-specific language) is a language specialized to a particular application domain. For example `Groovy` that was created for Gradle's build scripts.

Kotlin dsl with gradle means to use the kotlin `build.gradle.kts` instead of the groovy `build.gradle`.
Kotlin is so general that it reaches specific programming niche.

## Basic set up

Basic set up for your kotlin project with Gradle **4.8**:

- group: the top level package(s) under `src.main`
- version: the version of your application

```kotlin
allprojects {
    group = "hello"
    version = "1.0"
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}
```

You want to specify the kotlin version and plugin you wish to use:

```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("jvm") version "1.3.21"
}
```

And add the basic dependencies:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    compile(kotlin("stdlib"))
    // Or compile("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:1.3.21")
}
```

## Code Coverage

### JUnit

To look at coverage that means you have unit test.
Don't forget to add something like JUnit into your dependencies:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    testCompile("junit:junit:4.12")
}    
```

### Jacoco

#### Create code coverage task

Code coverage with jacoco plugin

```kotlin
plugins {
    jacoco
}
```

Then add the task

```kotlin
tasks.withType<JacocoReport> {
    reports {
        xml.isEnabled = true
        csv.isEnabled = false
        html.destination = file("${buildDir}/reports/jacoco")
    }
}
```

You can now roll the test code coverage with jacoco using `gradle test jacocoTestReport`.

#### Ignore a class from coverage

If you have a `main` class which can't be tested and you'd rather remove it from coverage, you would do it like:

```kotlin
tasks.withType<JacocoReport> {
    doFirst {
        classDirectories = fileTree("build/classes/kotlin/main").apply {
            exclude("**/MainKt.class")
        }
    }
    
    // ... your other stuff
    
}
```

And `MainKt` is not considered for the coverage anymore!

## Execute the project

### With the Application gradle plugin

It is a plugin available with gradle, add it to your gradle script like:

```kotlin
plugins {
    application
}
```

Then set your application main file: 

- It has to be outside of a class
- The `Kt` at the end is normal, Kotlin automatically generates it for backward compatibility with Java classes

```kotlin
application {
    mainClassName = "hello.MainKt"
}
```

Now you can run your program with:

```bash
gradle run
```

### Make the fat Jar

The fat jar task (updated to work with Gradle `5.x`:

```kotlin
val fatJar = task("fatJar", type = Jar::class) {
    baseName = "${project.name}-fat"
    manifest {
        attributes["Main-Class"] = "hello.MainKt"
    }
    from(
        configurations["runtimeClasspath"].map {
            if (it.isDirectory) it else zipTree(it)
        }
    )
    with(tasks["jar"] as CopySpec)
}
```

The jar will be created as `{project.name}-fat-{version}.jar` like `hello-kotlin-far-1.0.jar`.
You can then run it using:

```bash
java -jar hello-kotlin-far-1.0.jar
```

### Make the wrapper

For your project to work almost anywhere, you can use the wrapper:

```
gradle wrapper
```

Then you'll be able to use `./gradlew` instead of gradle and your project should run fine 👍

> Now if you have the opportunity to use a newer version of gradle, do it.
