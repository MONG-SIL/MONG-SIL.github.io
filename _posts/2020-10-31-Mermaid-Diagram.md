[Mermaid.js](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/) is a js library that transforms text into diagrams 
(sequence, Gantt or class diagrams, flow charts, ...).

So far the ones that I am particularly keen on using are the sequence diagrams, you can find all of the documentation, 
on the mermaid [site](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/diagrams-and-syntax-and-examples/).

## Sequence Diagram

So let's have a simple example. 
We will be mapping with some notes and colors the simple call flow of a client talking to an app.
This is pretty basic but covers most of our daily needs.

Writing down in simple mermaid script a call flow:

```bash
sequenceDiagram
  participant C as client
  participant A as App
  participant B as Database
  rect rgba(216,240,232, .7)
  C -->> A : Init connection
  A -->> C: Acknowledge connection
  end
  C ->> A : Send request
  Note over C,A : Each request have a unique ID
  A ->> B : Query the database
  opt Concurrency
    B -->> B : Other operation occuring in the database
  end
  B ->> A : Retrieve information
  Note left of B: Retrieve time < 10ms
  A ->> C : Send requested information
```

By default gitlab understand the markdown formatting `mermaid` so it's pretty straightforward in your markdown file.
But elsewhere like in this blog I am putting the above syntax in a `<div class="mermaid">` so that it will get picked up and rendered. 
(Kramdown which is the highlighting engine for jekyll and Github is not yet mermaid compatible).

And here it is the rendered diagram:

<div class="mermaid"> 
sequenceDiagram
  participant C as client
  participant A as App
  participant B as Database
  rect rgba(216,240,232, .7)
  C -->> A : Init connection
  A -->> C: Acknowledge connection
  end
  C ->> A : Send request
  Note over C,A : Each request have a unique ID
  A ->> B : Query the database
  opt Concurrency
    B -->> B : Other operation occuring in the database
  end
  B ->> A : Retrieve information
  Note left of B: Retrieve time < 10ms
  A ->> C : Send requested information
</div>


### Cheat sheet

#### Basics

The Basic, like using tabs and `sequenceDiagram` to create a sequence diagram.
You can also `autonumber` to add a number to each step of the sequence.

> Note that `%%` is used to add comments and won't be rendered.

And here is some cheat sheet for the things you can do with it.

- Participants with just letters: `participant C as client`
- Specific squared actions with _par_, _loop_ or _opt_ blocks
    ```bash
    [ par | loop | opt ] title
        ... content ...
    end
    ```
- Add block of notes in yellow using. If multiple actors, use the comma to separate them (usually when you want your note over multiples actors).
    ```bash
    Note [ right | left | over ] of [ Participant ]
    ``` 

#### Lines

Lines are basically the steps in your sequence diagram: 

  - You have the syntax looking like that:
     ```bash
    [ Participant ] [ Link ] [ Participant ]: Message.
    ``` 
  - If the Participant is the same, the line will just kind of loop on itself (like with database step above).

For the lines it always have `-`:

   - Two dash `--` means dotted (like `-->`)
   - Two chevrons `>>` means arrow head (like `->>`)
   - A cross `x` means cross in the arrow (like `-x`)

You can also have a `+` or `-` that will create a box at the edge of the link to indicate it's _activated_ or _deactivated_.
