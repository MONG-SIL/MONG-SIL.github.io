# Kubernetes

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is an opensource orchestrator allowing to automate the deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications.
Also named k8s the 8 for the eight letters in "ubernete" plus "s".

It was originally developped by Google in Go.
Kubernetes means "Helmsman" the guy who holds "Governor" in greek. Let's get sailing!

## Helm

With Kubernetes, you have [Helm](https://helm.sh/) which act as the packet manager for kubernetes.

Helm comes with `charts` that allow oneself to deploy a certain cluster with a single command line. 

Most of the charts are community maintained, they help define, install and define the application.
They work using template with values that can then be changed easily in one place the `values.yml` file.

## Components High-level

### Application from Container to Pods

The **containerized** application is available on multiple replica containers. 
These containers are regrouped by **Pods**.

On a worker there are multiple pods. 
A **worker** is a high level application block in Kubernetes.

The worker can have interaction with the outisde of thanks to an **ingress node** which act as a proxy for everything coming in.
The worker can also interact with the outside, by sending information and else using an **egress node** which act as a reverse proxy for external outgoing communication.

### Node Overview

A minion or a **node** is where the worker machine is situated.
It includes the services for **Docker** (container), **Kubelet** (management) and **Kubeproxy** (network). 

The kubelet is the primary “node agent” that runs on each node. The kubelet works in terms of a **PodSpec**. 
A PodSpec is a YAML or JSON object that describes a pod.
It then make sure that the pods descriped by the PodSpec are healthy. 

The Kubernetes network proxy or **kubeproxy** runs on each node, it is defined in the Cluster and tells how and through which ports the docker can in the pods can communicate. 

### Kubernetes Cluster

A **cluster** is a group of worker nodes controlled by a master node which controls the replication and the management of the worker nodes.

All the nodes of the cluster uses **etcd**, the backend for service discovery which stores cluster state and configuration.

The **kubernetes API server** is a front head and a REST API for the etcd backend.

The cluster as a cli name **kubectl** which allow to control and get information on the Cluster.

```bash
# Show Merged kubeconfig settings.
kubectl config view
```
