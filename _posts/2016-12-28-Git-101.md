## Git commands

Some of the basic git commands and what they do.

### Simple workflow to get started

Let say you have set up your repository, you can access it via [ssh](https://sylhare.github.io/2017/04/19/Get-started-with-Github.html) or https.
You have its link (we usually prefer via SSH, but the commands are the same with both).

You first clone the repository:

```bash
# Cloning a repo via ssh
git clone git@github.com:sylhare/Type-on-Strap.git
```

The you can do some modification, review them using and prepare your commit

```bash
# Review the state of repo
git status
# Add a the file name `new_file.md`
git add new_file.md
# Or add everything you've modified
git add --All
```

If you redo `git status`, you will see the changes you have added are now `staged`.
You can commit them and push it to remote using:

```bash
# Create a commit with a message using
git commit -m "Add new_file.md"
# Make sure you have the last version of the repo, the --rebase for a smoother pull 
git pull --rebase
# Push your commit to remote
git push 
```

And that's it.
    
### See log of the repository

Use:

    git log

To exit `git log` type `q` on the terminal.
For more magic with `git log` check out [Magic stats with git](https://sylhare.github.io/2019/07/28/Magic-stats-with-git.html)

### Stash changes

This can be used when you are updating your local repository with the remote one and avoid conflicts. 
For example when you have changes not committed and you need to pull before a commit.
A basic workflow would be to stash, pull, commit and re apply your stash.

```bash
# To save your local changes as 'stash'
git stash 
# To delete a stash
git drop <stash sha>

# To get back the last modification from stash and delete it
git pop 
# To get the local changes from a stash and keep it
git apply <stash sha>
```


### Create a branch

Get the states of the repository

```bash
# See the repo remotely
git remote -v
# See the branch locally
git branch
```


step by step:

```bash
# Create the branch
git branch patch-1
# Go inside the branch
git checkout patch-1
```

Other use case:

```bash
# Create a branch locally and checkout in one line
git checkout -b patch-1
# Add a remote branch and fetch it
git checkout --track origin/patch-1
```

### Revert a commit

Commits are identified by a special number, a commit hash (SHA) like `860652a4ab3749a72401b2ceaacf68b27afbc404`.
It can also be identified with the first 7 numbers like `860652a`

To revert you need to use:

    git revert 860652a -m 1
    
Which will revert the merge commit `860652a` to the previous commit with the `1`.

### Amend a commit

When you have made a mistake or you want to modify your last commit. (Usually the one not pushed to master)
Try using:

```bash
git commit --amend
```

It will allow you to change the commit name and the modifications included in the commit.

### Rename multiple commits

Using rebase:

```bash
# To return three commits back
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

You will see the commits, use `reword` in the one to change.
Validate by doing:

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

At the end, to push remote, don't forget to add `--force`. 
Bear in mind that you'll mess up the history for whoever had a previous version.
So use with caution.

If your commit started with `#` which is by default a comment. 
You can change the comment symbol using:

```bash
git config core.commentChar ";"
# Then put it back with
git config core.commentChar "#"
```

### Other tips

#### Remote folder and repository links

Remove a folder from git but not local:

	git rm -r --cached myFolder
	
Remove a folder from git

    git remote add <remote nickname> https://github.com/user/repository
    git rm -r one-of-the-directories
    git commit -m "Remove duplicated directory"
    git push origin <your-git-branch> # typically 'master', but not always
