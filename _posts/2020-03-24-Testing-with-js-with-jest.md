## Introduction

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is an Open source test framework developed by Facebook and compatible
with a lot of framework.

Jest is fast, and already pre configured to get started with it. So it simply works.
it adapts to run your test in parallel to reduce the total amount it takes to run them.

## Basic test

The syntax is pretty standard based on [jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) test framework.
Jest by default will consider as test files anything in a `test/` folder or ending with `.spec.js` or `.test.js`.
You can restrict that by overriding the basic configurations.

```js
describe("Jest tests", function () {
  // Adds todo on what needs to be tested
  test.todo('Well this is not exactly how it should be tested'); 
  
  it('is a simple test', () => {
    test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
      expect(function() { return 1 + 2; }).toBe(3);
    });
  });
  
});
```

## With snapshot

You can also test using snapshots. Very useful with legacy code with no tests.
It basically keep in memory what the output was. 
When failing, it will ask you either to update the snapshot or not. 
Testing only with snapshot is not recommended because you can let bug pass in tests by mistake.

```js
it('will fail every time', () => {
  const user = {
    createdAt: new Date(),
    id: Math.floor(Math.random() * 20),
    name: 'LeBron James',
  };

  // You can tweak the snapshot not to fail on trivial changes  
  expect(user).toMatchSnapshot({
    createdAt: expect.any(Date),
    id: expect.any(Number),
  }); 
});
```

## Jest Tips and tricks

Here are some commands you can add in your package.json to work with jest:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "debug": "jest --watch",
    "coverage": "jest --coverage",
    "clear_jest": "jest --clearCache"
  },
```

Just `jest` runs the test, but you might want to use:
  - `--watch` to run the tests automatically at each modifications.  
You can also specify in the watch which tests to re-run in case you have a lot.
  - `--coverage` to get the coverage right from the testing tool
  - `--clearCache`when jest get jammed (happened to me with Vue.js Framework), 
  last resort when tests are failing for no reasons 


One last, that was useful when linting the project was this one to easy fix trailing spaces and other noise errors using:
```json
"lint": "eslint --fix . --ext .js src test/unit test/e2e/specs"
```
